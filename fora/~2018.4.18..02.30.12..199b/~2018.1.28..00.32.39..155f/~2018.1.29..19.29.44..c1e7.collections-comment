This was caused by an oversight, but got fixed in [urbit/arvo#603](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/603).

Does this cause your urbit to not boot properly? It really shouldn't, it's just an app that's doing something stupid.  
I'd tell you to put in the updates arvo files manually if that's the case, but since you can't get into dojo then you can't `|mount /=base=` if you haven't already...

So, let me know, can you still access dojo? You might also get a sync with the fix automagically if you can boot.
