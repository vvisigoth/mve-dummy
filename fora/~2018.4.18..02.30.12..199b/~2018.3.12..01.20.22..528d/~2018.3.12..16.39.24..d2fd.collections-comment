Because we optimize the system until it works fast enough for development, then go work on something else :-)

Urbit is an OS and there's actually quite a lot of complicated things that happen when you press a key.  Squeezing those things down until lag is imperceptible is an important optimization problem -- but it's also a serious optimization problem.  What we've done so far is casual optimization, to get slowness out of our way.  "Premature optimization," etc -- there is a time for serious optimization, but it's basically when everything else works perfectly.
