> urbit-dev tool for your Hoon needs
~digwet-lintyr


Anyone who developed any significant Hoon app, knows it is a pain to keep 
the source both under git and clay. While we wait for clay to morph into fully fledged revision control system, I have made a simple tool which scans your source code, and auto-symlinks arvo-conforming files into your chosen desk.

# Where

The git repo is [here](https://github.com/mikolajpp/urbit-dev/blob/master/urbit-dev.py)

# How

Clone the repo, make it executable and use at will!

`urbit-dev.py link src desk`

Will scan your source code tree for all arvo directories (app/, mar/ etc.), and symlink them into urbit desk, creating any necessary (sub)directories as needed. 

If enough martians will use it, I may consider getting the package into pip for easier install :)
