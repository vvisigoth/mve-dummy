> Sail Interpolations

Hello All, 

I've been bothering various Tlonians and Martians over the last few days, trying to figure out how to properly do interpolations in Sail. This seems pretty important if you're going to publish anything interesting on your Urbit. 

It appears to me that there are a few runes that only show up in Sail: `;*` `;=` and `;+` 

I can't find any documentation for these and their use in the wild still leaves me scratching my head. 

Here's an example from https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/master/web/unmark/all.hoon#L62 

So it appears that sail can be cast to a manx (as expected), and that a `marl` (a list of xml nodes) can be inserted into a bunch of sail. OK. That makes sense. But when I try do something like the below, nothing renders 

``` 
^- manx 
  ;div 
    ;*  ;=  (need (de-xml:html '<div>foo</div>')) 
         == 
    == 
``` 

And then there is the matter of the curly brackets (`*{foo}` `+{foo}` `-{foo}`), which are used in the above example code in a way that I am unfamiliar with. Can someone clarify how these interpolations work in Sail?
