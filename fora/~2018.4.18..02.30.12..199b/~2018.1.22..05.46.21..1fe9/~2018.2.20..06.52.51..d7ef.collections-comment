Note that we are likely to change `++duct` from `(list wire)` to `(list vase)` (or maybe change `++wire` from `path` to `vase`) so each app and vane doesn't have to define its own data serialization format to squeeze it into a `++path`. Once the Hoon pretty printer includes doccords, this could be made relatively human-readable.
