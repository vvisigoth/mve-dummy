My take at your last question is, maybe Urbit should be steered in a direction where there won't ever be a need for a user to open top. 

These days I rarely open top on my graphical linux desktop: my GUI handles these for me. 
If it detects app became unresponsive, it presents an option to kill it (top also would not give a reason why it hanged). Maybe Urbit top should be treated purely as statistics & information gathering tool (useful, we need it), and not something to be wished to be integral part of Urbit experience. 

Apps which wait too long on HTTP GET should abort and present a message. 
Long running computation hogs should be treated as bugs and fixed. And so on. 

PS
But short term we need this in Urbit ;-)
