I don't take for granted that the viewers will see the style choices of other users.

While we cannot force users to follow style conventions on their own servers, we can make it more likely by providing good flexibility in 'sane' design space by default.

Users may prefer to render content on their own servers in the :tree-type viewer you mentioned.
That option may help curtail truly horrendous style choices.
