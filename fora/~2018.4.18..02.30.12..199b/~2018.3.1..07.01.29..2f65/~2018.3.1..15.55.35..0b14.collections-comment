Of course, there is a (high) chance PWA will continue at the current pace, which means in a couple of years 60fps PWAs will also be possible. 

Facebook for example could be fighting back against abandoning them or even vigorously funding opposition since I sense a lot of borgs are looking at PWAs as a break-out-of-appstore-jail card, which incidentially aligns with urbit goals. 

"I want to believe" ;-)

performant PWAs are a dream come true. I am tired of the general ugliness of the web and its non-operability with any desktop, non-integration to anything that matters.

Github recently rolled out (electron) desktop apps, and for a good reason. No-one really wants to use horrible browser interfaces. Browsers only got one thing right, that they provide copy-and-paste. That's pretty much the extent of their integration with user-facing system.
Noone has thought of removing the top browser bar and providing context menu in desktop enviroment, something which is long available on mobile. 
What's worse, even electron is alien: even drag and drop does not work on desktop. 
I cringe every time how much regress is happening with web-technology creeping. 
We are at a point when writing text editor interface is a huge industrial undertaking, because GUI toolkits has been neglected, and the only thing left is browser-engine.

We are entering tumultous times, but at least we at urbit always have terminal to rant in urbit-meta ;^)
