~palfun-foslup
~lorfep, a number of things still remain to be done before we put everything live.

We may want to put MUW through more rigorous testing (I only did a quick pass so far). We're also waiting to hear back from the folks auditing our Ethereum contracts. Hopefully there won't be much additional work coming from that, but who knows. Lastly, we've yet to settle on and implement a method for transferring ownership to Ethereum.

This is the last stretch, but we want to make sure we don't rush into things before we're actually fully ready.
