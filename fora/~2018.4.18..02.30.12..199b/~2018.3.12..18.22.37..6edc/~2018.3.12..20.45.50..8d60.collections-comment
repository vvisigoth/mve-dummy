To expand a bit on ~fantyc's answer,  
Yes, people will likely be putting their planets on servers provided by urbit hosting providers. But that's really no different from relying on a hosting provider for your website. You don't consider your website as their data, and you don't expect them to go snooping through it either. That'd be a breach of trust (and usually also contract) which their PR and legal departments won't be happy with.
