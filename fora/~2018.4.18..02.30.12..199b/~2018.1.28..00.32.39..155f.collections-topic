> Can't boot up my planet after successful post-breach boot?

I booted up my planet three days ago, repeating the setup steps in the urbit docs. After a few hours in talk, I started getting odd errors, so I `ctrl-c`ed out of the urbit process. Now, on doing a `urbit bostec-tasmex` I get:

```~

and I can't find related issues in the urbit git repo.
